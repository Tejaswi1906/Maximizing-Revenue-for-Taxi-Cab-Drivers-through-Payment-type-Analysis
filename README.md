# Maximizing-Revenue-for-Taxi-Cab-Drivers-through-Payment-type-Analysis
The project aims to boost taxicab drivers' revenue by analyzing payment types, utilizing EDA, machine learning models, and business insights to optimize revenue strategies and customer satisfaction.
The project aims to analyze trip details and revenue distribution using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and machine learning models. Key focus areas include identifying which payment method generates the highest revenue, determining if cash customers tip less, and analyzing trip distance and fare pricing. Machine learning approaches include data preprocessing, encoding categorical variables, feature scaling, and model training. Results show that card payments and digital wallets generate higher revenue per trip, while cash transactions have lower tips. Promotions for digital payments can encourage higher-value rides, and longer trips are more likely to be paid by card. This data-driven insight helps businesses and drivers make informed decisions to maximize revenue.
